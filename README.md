# ðŸŒ¾ Rice Leaf Disease Detection Using Deep Learning

## Overview
The **Rice Leaf Disease Detection** project is designed to automatically identify different diseases affecting the **M04 rice leaf variety** using deep learning techniques. This system helps farmers and researchers detect diseases early by analyzing rice leaf images, supporting better crop management and improving yield.

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to create a reliable and efficient system that can classify multiple rice leaf diseases, including:
- **Bacterial Leaf Blight**
- **Leaf Scald**
- **Neck Blast**
- **Tungro**

## Motivation
Rice is a vital food crop, and its production can be severely impacted by leaf diseases, which may lead to significant yield loss. Manual identification of these diseases is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. This project offers an automated solution, making disease detection fast, accurate, and accessible to farmers.

## How It Works
1. Users provide an image of a rice leaf.  
2. A **deep learning model** analyzes the image and predicts the disease.  
3. The system displays the disease name and confidence level.  
4. Optionally, a **chatbot interface** provides additional information about the disease and suggestions for treatment or prevention.

## Visual Appearance
- The **web interface** allows users to upload rice leaf images easily.  
- Prediction results are displayed clearly with the disease name and probability.  
- A **chatbot panel** may guide the user and provide explanations or remedies.  
- The UI is simple, clean, and user-friendly, focusing on accessibility for farmers and researchers.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for the backend and model development  
- **Keras / TensorFlow** for the deep learning model  
- **Django** for the web application  
- **Rasa** for the conversational AI chatbot  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for the frontend interface

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how artificial intelligence and computer vision can solve real-world agricultural challenges. By combining deep learning, web technologies, and conversational AI, the system makes rice leaf disease detection efficient, accurate, and accessible.
