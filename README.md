# ðŸŒ¾ Rice Leaf Disease Detection Using Deep Learning

The Rice Leaf Disease Detection project aims to automatically identify different types of diseases affecting the M04 rice leaf variety using deep learning techniques. This system assists farmers and agricultural researchers by providing early and accurate detection of diseases from leaf images, helping in better crop management and yield improvement.

## Project Objective
The main goal of this project is to design and develop a deep learning model capable of detecting and classifying rice leaf diseases with high accuracy. The model can recognize the following diseases:
- Bacterial Leaf Blight
- Leaf Scald
- Neck Blast
- Tungro

## Motivation
Rice is a staple food crop for a large part of the world, especially in India. However, rice production is severely affected by various leaf diseases, which can lead to significant yield losses. Manual identification of these diseases is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. This project provides an automated, efficient, and reliable solution to detect rice leaf diseases using image processing and deep learning techniques.
